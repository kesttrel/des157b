    <p>SpreadKindness.org is a non-profit organization that offers resources related to kindness tools and projects. This organization is geared towards serving actual people with actual resources, but it is not a very interactice web-based space. Their website is a bit dated but uses page load transitions.</p>
    <h2>Kinder World</h2>

    <p>Kindlab is a research group that investigates the causes and effects of kindess. This website is a great resouce as it provides evidence and research based tips and practices to spreading kindess and making an impact. I think it would be interesting to list some of these resources on my own project from Kindlab to give people examples of kind and impactful actions they can take.</p>
