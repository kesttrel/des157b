    <h2>Letters Anonymous</h2>

    <p>This website takes an interesting approach to virutal community building by providing an open space for people to write letters annonymously to others or themselves. Overall, I like the minimalism of this website and how the cards are presented in a grid. I would be curious to see the data presented through paginzaiton instead of a long page scrolling website, or perhaps through mouse hovering on the right or left side of the browser.</p>

    <h2>Kinder World</h2>

    <p>Kindlab is a research group that investigates the causes and effects of kindess. This website is a great resouce as it provides evidence and research based tips and practices to spreading kindess and making an impact. I think it would be interesting to list some of these resources on my own project from Kindlab to give people examples of kind and impactful actions they can take.</p>
