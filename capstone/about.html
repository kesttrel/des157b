                <h1>About this project</h1>
                <p>This webisite was created in response to the loss of well-known community member and leader David Breaux. David, a self described 'Steet-Therapist,' spent many hours on the Compassion Bench asking passing community members what compassion meant to them. David was a valued community member whose message can be both seen, heard, and felt throughout the Davis community.</p>
                <p>The graphic images of the sunflower, hand, star, poppies, tree, and peace sign are all inspired by ceramic tilework featured on the Compassion Bench. These images were drawn using imagery from the tilework and painted with watercolour by designer Kestrel Hewson. Thank you to the ceramic tile artists Donna Blillick and Mark Rivera for their original art on the bench that inspired these interpretations.</p>
                <p>In addition to David's work, this project could not have been possible without the City of Davis and the work of Susan Shelton on the Davis Centennial Seal.</p>

                <h1>The Compassion Bench</h1>
                <p>The construction of the Compassion Bench, located on <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/Gt96GJSfdaWoNtwK7" class="link">Compassion Corner at the corner of 3rd and C Street</a>, was organized by David Breaux. The bench is a functional community art sculpture that displays words that relate to or support compassion. Each word has it's own unique mini-mural inlay into the sides and backing of the bench with a "compassion is" set of inlays providing context for the other words. Compassion is gratitude, listenting, empathy, understanding, forgiving.</p>
                <p>David Breaux's work largely influenced the creation of this bench and David played a critical role in it's founding. The bench was designed by natural builder Brennan Bird. The Ceramic panels were created by local ceramic tile artists Donna Blillick and Mark Rivera.</p>

                <h1>The Davis Centennial Seal</h1>
                <p>Within the Davis Centennial Seal is further evidence of compassionate leadership in the history of the City of Davis. Pictured to the left is a close-up image from a graphic panel that tells the story of such leadership.</p>
                <p>At the top right corner of this panel Dr. John H. Jones is depicted looking into a child's ear. Dr. Jones would bring his medical practice to migrant camps and to concerts to provide free healthcare to those with the least access to it. He also began the Davis Free Clinic which later became Communicare.</p>
                <p>In the center of the panel imagery representing Measure A is included. Measure A was a measure to divest from apartheid South Africa and it was first adopted by the city and later by UC Davis. Davis was one of the earliest towns to adopt divestment from apartheid South Africa.</p>
                <p>In the top left corner of of the panel Davis Community Housing is represented. Davis Community Housing has a history of suppring United Farm Workers.</p>
                <p>Credit to Susan Shelton for the description of this panel.</p>
