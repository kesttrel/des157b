    <h1>Project Brief</h1>
    <h2>Project Summary:</h2>
    <p>This project will focus on stories related to compassion through a web app that will be fully responsive with emphasis on mobile usability. This project connects to the Davis Centennial Seal through and the value of community by creating a space where the community can reflect on their thoughts and experiences regarding compassion, which is an essential quality for a healthy community, in the hopes of inspiring more compassionate action in our community. This project will be dedicated to the memory of David Breaux, otherwise known as the “Compassion Guy” in hopes of continuing his pursuit of spreading compassion.</p>
    <h2>Project Goals:</h2>
    <p>My project intends to benefit users through presenting them with the opportunity to engage in mindful reflection and meditation on what compassion means to them, notable moments of compassion they have received from or provided to their loved ones and communities, and inspire people to take more compassionate action both internally and externally.</p>
    <p>To do this I’ll need to create a web app that can create, read, and upload data(text+image).</p>
    <p>Pages:</p> 
    <ul>
        <li>Dashboard with grid of posts with create post feature</li>
        <li>About Page</li>
        <li>Memorial Page for David (or I could nest within about page, or include in footer (would need to be a large footer))</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Design Strategies: </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Minimalism</li>
        <li>My plan is to have a grid based post system that displays cards containing a post.
            I will likely provide a selection of custom made illustrations/patterns that people can select for their posts.<br>I am considering creating watercolors with a wide range of colors to make the page feel more alive and connected to the physical world. I don’t want this to look more like a beautiful collage than a web-app on a grid system. </li>
        <li>I will use color only on the background of the cards and for cover effects, otherwise the page will toggle between an off-white light-mode and off-black dark-mode set of designs.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Interaction Strategies:</h2>
    <p>I will use the animate on scroll library to animate the content on the about and memorial page. I will also find a library that will give visual feedback for error handeling and successful post notifications.</p>
    <h2>Experience Goals:</h2>
    <p>I want to make the users feel relaxed, present and reflective. </p>
    <p>I plan on achieving this by creating a deck of cards that users can choose from that will work together to create a beautiful and artful grid system of images.</p>
    <p>I will also include transitions and interaction effects to increase intuitive usability and (hopefully) make the application enjoyable to use.</p>
    <h2>Target Users:</h2>
    <p>Davis residents with access to a smartphone who sit on the compassion bench in downtown.</p>
    <h2>Questions:</h2>
    <p>Should I contact David Breaux’s family to request their participation in the selection of images and words for the section of the web-app that will be dedicated to him?</p>
